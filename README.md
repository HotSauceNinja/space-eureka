### The Quest ‚öî

**As a team member, I want to see a list of results pulled from a public API of the
engineers choosing displayed on a web page because it allows me to see how the
engineer writes code.**

#### Acceptance Criteria

Given I view the page
When the application fetches data from an API
Then only the first 10 results should be displayed
And I should see a load more button

Given I view the page
And initial results have been loaded
When I press the load more button
Then the next N results should be loaded

#### Requirements üõ†:

- Don‚Äôt use any JavaScript/CSS frameworks
- Use Web Components if you‚Äôd like!
- README.md with instructions on how to run and view it
- Put it up on a git repo

#### What we are looking for üïµ‚ôÄ:

- Code quality
- Any programming patterns
- Simple design, functionality, and implementation
- Reusability of components
- Performant JS/CSS

### Completing your Quest üèÜ

**Once you have completed the task and submitted it back to us we will then arrange for a
second call. We will spend some time reviewing your solution and then also work on adding
some new features to it during a pair programming session.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.**

Good luck and we hope you have fun! ‚≠ê
